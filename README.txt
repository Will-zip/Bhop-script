		Will's quick and dirty bhop script   
(Feel free to improve this, dm on twitter @WillOnTheInt if you want me to update this)

1. Copy/paste these lines these lines into your autoexec

	bind "whateverbuttonyouwant" "exec NoBhop"
        bind "whateverbuttonyouwant" "exec Bhop"

	(I use mouse 4/5, but not everybody will have those)

2. Drag and drop both cfg files into your TeamFortress/tf/cfg folder. 
 (left click on the game in steam, go to manage, open local files)

3. Type in "exec autoexec" if you have problems on launch
